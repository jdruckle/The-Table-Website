                    Hello Dear Hearts,
                    <br /><br />
                    How is everyone doing? These certainly are unprecedented days, aren&#039;t they?
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong><u>Let&#039;s start with the good news!</u></strong>
                    <blockquote>
                      Love will not run out
                      <br />Compassion is not cancelled<br />
                      Neighborliness is still our calling<br />
                      Listening opens our hearts to courage
                    </blockquote>
                    If it feels like the ground is shifting beneath your feet, it&#039;s because it is. Here is what is not shifting: God&#039;s love, your community&#039;s care for you, the ground of your being and the accessibility of light, hope and peace. All of these remain the same.
                    <strong><u>More good news, although different!</u></strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Upon learning of the recommendations of the state government, and the action of the NCSD to suspend school until April 5th, and the advisement of the CDC that gatherings of more than 50 be suspended for the next 8 weeks, <strong>we are going to go to virtual gatherings as a community for the next three weeks</strong> (March 18, 25 and April 1st). We will reevaluate as we go.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Friends, we will still gather on Wednesday evenings; with a shift to virtual space rather than physical space. </i>We will gather between 6:30 and 7:30pm for reflection, contemplation &amp; action together. The platform for this virtual gathering is still being determined, and will be announced shortly - but it will allow for folks to join by telephone conference or video conference - which means all of us will be able to join in regardless of technological savvy. Instructions to follow!
                    <br><br>
                    This week on Wednesday we will create plenty of space to process these strange times we find ourselves living in. We will also spend some time with chapter seven &quot;Fish Stories&quot; of Rachel Held Evans&#039; book, &quot;Inspired.&quot;
                    <br><br>
                    Listed below under &quot;resources&quot; are a few practices you can use to feed the love-generator and starve the fear-monster; as well as some practical resources from around the community that are being made available in these strange times.
                    <br><br>
                    Until Wednesday, let us chose persistence in love. You&#039;re allowed to be afraid, you&#039;re allowed to be anxious, you&#039;re allowed to be sad; you&#039;re allowed to be frustrated and annoyed; you&#039;re allowed to be tired. How will you acknowledge these emotions and choose your response?
                    <br><br>
                    <strong><u>Check-in</u></strong>

                    <br />3. I can turn off the T.V., radio, and social media. I do not have to be plugged in to the news cycle or panicked world at all times

                    <strong>Spiritual </strong>
                    <br />1. I can write down two things I am grateful for every day
                    <br />2. I can speak honestly with God (the Divine)

                    <br><br>
                    Psalm 23
                    <br><br>
                    The Lord is my shepherd;
                    <br />I have all that I need.
                    <br />He lets me rest in green meadows;
                    <br />he leads me beside peaceful streams.
                    <br />He renews my strength.
                    <br />He guides me along right paths,
                    <br />bringing honor to his name.
                    <br />Even when I walk
                    <br />through the darkest valley,
                    <br />I will not be afraid,
                    <br />for you are close beside me.
                    <br />Your rod and your staff
                    <br />protect and comfort me.
                    <br />You prepare a feast for me
                    <br />in the presence of my enemies.
                    <br />You honor me by anointing my head with oil.
                    <br />My cup overflows with blessings.
                    <br />Surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me
                    <br />all the days of my life,
                    <br />and I will live in the house of the Lord
                    <br />
                    forever.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong><u>Scripture</u></strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Luke 12:25-31(NLT)
                    <br />Can all your worries add a single moment to your life? And if worry can’t accomplish a little thing like that, what’s the use of worrying over bigger things?
                    <br />Look at the lilies and how they grow. They don’t work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are. And if God cares so wonderfully for flowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith? And don’t be concerned about what to eat and what to drink. Don’t worry about such things. These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers all over the world, but your Father already knows your needs. Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and he will give you everything you need.

                    <br><br>
                    &quot;Lockdown&quot;
                    <br />-from Richard Hendrick (Brother Richard) in Ireland
                    <br />March 13th 2020
                    <br><br>
                    Yes there is fear.
                    <br />Yes there is isolation.
                    <br />Yes there is panic buying.
                    <br />Yes there is sickness.
                    <br />Yes there is even death.
                    <br />But,
                    <br />They say that in Wuhan after so many years of noise
                    <br />You can hear the birds again.
                    <br />They say that after just a few weeks of quiet
                    <br />The sky is no longer thick with fumes
                    <br />But blue and grey and clear.
                    <br />They say that in the streets of Assisi
                    <br />People are singing to each other
                    <br />across the empty squares,
                    <br />keeping their windows open
                    <br />so that those who are alone
                    <br />may hear the sounds of family around them.
                    <br />They say that a hotel in the West of Ireland
                    <br />Is offering free meals and delivery to the housebound.
                    <br />Today a young woman I know
                    <br />is busy spreading fliers with her number
                    <br />through the neighbourhood
                    <br />So that the elders may have someone to call on.
                    <br />Today Churches, Synagogues, Mosques and Temples
                    <br />are preparing to welcome
                    <br />and shelter the homeless, the sick, the weary
                    <br />All over the world people are slowing down and reflecting
                    <br />All over the world people are looking at their neighbours in a new way
                    <br />All over the world people are waking up to a new reality
                    <br />To how big we really are.
                    <br />To how little control we really have.
                    <br />To what really matters.
                    <br />To Love.
                    <br />So we pray and we remember that
                    <br />Yes there is fear.
                    <br />But there does not have to be hate.
                    <br />Yes there is isolation.
                    <br />But there does not have to be loneliness.
                    <br />Yes there is panic buying.
                    <br />But there does not have to be meanness.
                    <br />Yes there is sickness.
                    <br />But there does not have to be disease of the soul
                    <br />Yes there is even death.
                    <br />But there can always be a rebirth of love.
                    <br />Wake to the choices you make as to how to live now.
                    <br />Today, breathe.
                    <br />Listen, behind the factory noises of your panic
                    <br />The birds are singing again
                    <br />The sky is clearing,
                    <br />Spring is coming,
                    <br />And we are always encompassed by Love.
                    <br />Open the windows of your soul
                    <br />And though you may not be able
                    <br />to touch across the empty square,
                    <br />Sing.

                    <br><br>
                    We at Grab and Go Gourmet value the safety and wellbeing of our staff and customers as our biggest priority. We understand that school and other closures have made difficult situations for some of you, but we still want to be able to continue to serve the local community. We also understand the need for people not to be gathering. To serve our customers in the safest way possible, as of tomorrow, Grab and Go will provide free deliveries within Casper as well as curbside pickup service. Orders can be submitted by phone, Facebook, and Facebook Messenger. In addition, for those of you who want to continue to visit us at Grab and Go, we can offer take out, but no dine in guests. Please be assured that we will be extra vigilant by providing extra safety precautions to protect our staff and customers. We pray that you, your families, and your loved ones remain healthy through this challenging situation.
                    <br><br>
                    If the situation changes and we are required to close, we will notify you of this change.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, we recognize that those in our community most at risk in this situation need additional assistance. We will gladly accept donations to Food For Thought at the store to help those in need.
